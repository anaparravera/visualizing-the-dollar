## Background
In Venezuela we have currency control. People living abroad cannot simply send money to their relatives at home, and vice-versa. Because of this, the black market exists, where you can “sell” and “buy” dollars by transferring to a third party living abroad who in turn transfers Bolivares to the recipient’s account in Venezuela. The price of the dollar is in this market is called the “parallel price” and everyone always checks it on [dolartoday.com](https://dolartoday.com). Because of the hyperinflation and political situation Venezuela is facing, this price fluctuates drastically daily. People joke that you can never know “what the dollar will do tomorrow”.

More information about the black market can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_bol%C3%ADvar#Currency_black_market
